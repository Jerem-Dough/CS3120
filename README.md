## **CS3120**

In CS3120, we utilized Python and various libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn to explore core machine learning concepts, including regression, classification, clustering, neural networks, and deep learning.

## **Projects**

This repository contains various Python projects completed for CS3120, covering key machine-learning algorithms and techniques. Below is an overview of the project concepts:

- Linear Regression & Gradient Descent (LinearRegression.py):  
Implemented a linear regression model using gradient descent to optimize weight and bias values. The project visualizes the loss function landscape, tracks changes in parameters during optimization, and evaluates model performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE). Sample visualizations are included as PNG files.

- Polynomial Regression & Model Fitting (polynomial_regression.py):  
Explored polynomial regression for modeling nonlinear relationships between variables. The project tested polynomial models of varying degrees (2-25) and evaluated performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² scores. Training and testing losses were analyzed to identify overfitting and underfitting behaviors. Sample visualizations are included as PNG files.

Each project demonstrates key machine learning concepts, focusing on algorithmic implementation, data preprocessing, model evaluation, and optimization.

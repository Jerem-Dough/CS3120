## **CS3120**

In CS3120, we utilized Python and various libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn to explore core machine learning concepts, including regression, classification, clustering, neural networks, and deep learning.

## **Projects**

This repository contains various Python projects completed for CS3120, covering key machine-learning algorithms and techniques. Below is an overview of the project concepts:

- **Linear Regression & Gradient Descent (LinearRegression.py):**  
Implemented a linear regression model using gradient descent to optimize weight and bias values. The project visualizes the loss function landscape, tracks changes in parameters during optimization and evaluates model performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE). Sample visualizations are included as PNG files.

- **Polynomial Regression & Model Fitting (PolynomialRegression.py):**  
Explored polynomial regression for modeling nonlinear relationships between variables. The project tested polynomial models of varying degrees and evaluated performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² scores. Training and testing losses were analyzed to identify overfitting and underfitting behaviors. Sample visualizations are included as PNG files.

- **Logistic Regression & Binary Classification (BinaryClassification.py):**  
In this project, we implemented logistic regression to classify diabetes risk using the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset. The model predicts whether an individual has diabetes based on key health indicators such as glucose level, BMI, and age.

- **Multi-Class Classification with the Iris Dataset (MultipleClassifications.py):**  
This project applies three core machine learning classifiers—Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Logistic Regression—to the well-known Iris flower dataset. The goal was to evaluate how well each model performs in classifying three iris species based on features like petal and sepal dimensions.

- **Neural Network from Scratch (NeuralNetwork.py):**  
Implemented a basic 3-6-2 neural network using NumPy. Trained the model with forward/backward propagation and manual gradient descent to classify binary targets. Evaluated predictions on both training data and a new input [1, 1, 1].
